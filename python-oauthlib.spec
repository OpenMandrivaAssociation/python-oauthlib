%description
OAuth often seems complicated and difficult-to-implement. There are several
prominent libraries for handling OAuth requests, but they all suffer from
one or both of the following:

They predate the OAuth 1.0 spec, AKA RFC 5849.
They predate the OAuth 2.0 spec, AKA RFC 6749.
They assume the usage of a specific HTTP request library.

OAuthLib is a framework which implements the logic of OAuth1 or OAuth2 without
assuming a specific HTTP request object or web framework. Use it to graft OAuth
client support onto your favorite HTTP library, or provide support onto your
favourite web framework. If youâ€™re a maintainer of such a library, write a
thin veneer on top of OAuthLib and get OAuth support for very little effort.
